**TL;DR**: Punk’s DIY ethos lives on in code and AI—whether you’re scraping exams or tracking expenses, open-source repos and vector search let you take control.

## Intro

(176 BPM)  
1-2-3-4!

I’m a slob. That usually doesn’t end well.  
I don’t plan. My attention span is a busted cassette tape—short, warped, skipping all over the place.  
But here’s the thing: I like it that way.

I never wanted the spreadsheet life of a number cruncher. Never cared for polished shoes and stiff collars of classical music.  
A kid bashing out DIY three-chord songs in a garage full of misfits? Yeah. That’s more like it.

## Verse

Late ’70s punk was before my time. I grew up in the ’90s and ’00s. By then, DIY wasn’t happening with guitars—it was happening with code.  
- Guitar heroes → bedroom hackers  
- Stages → command lines  
- Zines → blogs  
- Mixtapes → open-source repos  

Major labels became big tech—hoarding your data, slicing it for the highest bidder. I’m not hating, but the system turns you into a consumer—click, scroll, “engage.”

## Bridge

How do you fight back? How do you take control of your life—your data—yourself?  

“Taking control” used to mean hand-logging every detail, jamming it into spreadsheets, exact-match SQL queries—no forgiveness for fuzzy searches. That’s not control; it’s digital paperwork with extra steps.

## Chorus

Now I don’t log expenses or calories like a caveman. I snap a photo—receipt or plate—OCR or AI extracts details and logs it automatically. No typing. No Googling “calories in two boiled eggs.”  

Then I embed that data as vectors—searchable by meaning, not exact words:

- “I was wiped out on Jan 15. What changed in my diet that week?”  
- “I blew my budget last month. What non-essential crap did I actually spend on?”  

It’s not just tracking, it’s understanding. Host it yourself, and you own your data—no Silicon Valley app selling your soul.

## Solo

What the hell am I doing talking about expenses and calories? My 20-year-old self would call me a sellout. Let’s try music:

Isolate riffs from The Clash—clip by clip—embed them with OpenL3, YAMNet, or Wav2Vec2. Store vectors in Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS. Later, embed your own riff, do a nearest-neighbor search:

- Channel London Calling, or choke on distortion?  

Your tone, rhythm, mistakes—they become data, traceable, learnable, yours.

## Outro

Punk isn’t dead. It just learned machine learning.
